#  Quick, get me a Dr.BERT: Automatic Grading of Evidence using  Transfer Learning
Code related to the ALTA's 2021 Shared Task - "Quick, get me a Dr.BERT: Automatic Grading of Evidence using  Transfer Learning". Our work was presented in ALTA 2021
The 19th Annual Workshop of the Australasian Language Technology Association


# What's this Read Me about ? 
Basically , it is to give you an overview on what is this project about. Keep in mind that I've built this very quick and dirty way. It is not in the best shape but I am trying to make sure that at least people can download it and make it easier for them to download and use it 


## Requirements

* python 3.7
* numpy
* sckikit-learn
* pandas
* ALTA 2021 Shared Data Challenge Dataset (Please kindly obtain for them) 

Will update with pip requirements.txt so that you can have the exact one. I will make it easier for you all :). At the moment , I apologize - you just need to go through the files for the imports and install the pip To make your life a bit easier , the major imports or the stuff that I use can be found in the following files below :) 

## What are the files for

TBA

## Problems Running ?

Raise an Issue or Reach out to me - I can help. Again it's my first time of publishing some public project. I try to follow best practices , so please pardon me if there are mistakes 

## TO-DO
* Improve the Read Me
* Refactor the Code - some of the file names do not even make sense or even the method. It can be optimized further 
* Add PIP Requirements
